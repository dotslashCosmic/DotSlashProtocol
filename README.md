DSP/DotSlashProtocol - A TCP/IP Fork

Based on [TUPacket](https://github.com/dotslashCosmic/TUPacket) by me :)

Still under construction
Warning- Python interpreter may turn \x hex chars into their respective ASCII forms in the header prints- it's only visual.

Features: 
- Smaller footprint
- larger payload per fragmentation(soon)
- TCP/UDP spoofing(soon)
